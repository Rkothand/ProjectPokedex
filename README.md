# ProjectPokedex
Hello this is a Project that i am making for my portfolio that is also partially for me to use and for you to use
There used to be a feature on the official pokemon website that allowed users to keep track of pokemon they had in their pokedex and a wishlist feature that is no longer available.
Additionally I have recieved a large amount of code from other Github users who have wrote databases for other tools and utuilized these to save me some time.
I would like to recreate this feature and have a pokedex tracker that i can use to keep track of which pokemon i still need to have complete pokedex.
In addition to this there is also additonal features that i would like to try such as a user-inputted where to obtain feature, and a living dex functionality.
